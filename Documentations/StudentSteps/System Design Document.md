## 1. Introduction

- **Purpose:** This document provides a detailed overview of the system design for StudentSteps. It describes the architecture, components, interfaces, and data design of the system.
- **Scope:** The system design covers the technical implementation aspects of StudentSteps and serves as a guide for developers, architects, and stakeholders involved in the project.

## 2. System Overview

- **System Goals:** StudentSteps aims to reduce the amount of complexity in writing and leaving comments, facilitate the communication between [the teachers/tutors and the parents/students], and allow students to be more self-reliant with how they study based on comments and making their own schedules.
- **System Features:** Key features include the ability to efficiently write, read, and approve comments for different audiences, as well as schedule tutors and homework.
- **Stakeholders:** Primary stakeholders include administrators, tutors, parents, and students.

## 3. Architecture Overview

- **Architecture Style:** Client-server Architecture will be used
- **Component Overview:** The main components of this application will be the server-side, the client-side, and the database.
- **Deployment Architecture:** This application is to be deployed on cloud infrastructure on Heroku with seperate environments for product, staging, and production.

## 4. Component Descriptions

- **Front-End Component:**
    - **Description:** Describe the purpose and functionality of the component.
    - **Dependencies:** List any dependencies or interactions with other components.
    - **Interfaces:** Describe the interfaces exposed by the component (e.g., APIs, libraries).
    - **Technologies:** React.js, Redux, React Router
    
- **Back-End Component:**
    - **Description:** Describe the purpose and functionality of the component.
    - **Dependencies:** List any dependencies or interactions with other components.
    - **Interfaces:** Describe the interfaces exposed by the component (e.g., APIs, libraries).
    - **Technologies:** React.js, Redux, React Router
    
- **Database Component:**
    - **Description:** Describe the purpose and functionality of the component.
    - **Dependencies:** List any dependencies or interactions with other components.
    - **Interfaces:** Describe the interfaces exposed by the component (e.g., APIs, libraries).
    - **Technologies:** React.js, Redux, React Router


(Repeat for each major component)

## 5. Data Design

- **Data Model:** Provide an overview of the data model, including entities, attributes, and relationships.
- **Database Design:** Describe the database schema, tables, indexes, and constraints.
- **Data Storage:** Discuss data storage options, including databases, file systems, caches, etc.

## 6. Interface Design

- **User Interface:** Describe the user interface design, including wireframes, mockups, and user interaction flows.
- **API Design:** Describe the design of APIs exposed by the system, including endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication mechanisms.
- **Integration Interfaces:** Discuss any external system integrations and the interfaces used for communication.

## 7. Security Design

- **Authentication and Authorization:** Describe the mechanisms for user authentication and authorization.
- **Data Security:** Discuss data encryption, access controls, and other security measures.
- **Network Security:** Describe network security measures, including firewalls, encryption protocols, etc.

## 8. Performance Considerations

- **Scalability:** Discuss the system's ability to scale horizontally or vertically to handle increased loads.
- **Performance Metrics:** Define performance metrics and targets for the system (e.g., response time, throughput).
- **Caching and Optimization:** Describe caching strategies and optimization techniques to improve performance.

## 9. Deployment Plan

- **Deployment Strategy:** Describe the deployment process, including staging, testing, and production environments.
- **Deployment Tools:** Discuss the tools and automation scripts used for deployment (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines).
- **Monitoring and Logging:** Describe the monitoring and logging setup for tracking system health and performance in production.

## 10. Maintenance and Support

- **Maintenance Plan:** Discuss the plan for ongoing maintenance and support of the system, including bug fixes, updates, and upgrades.
- **Troubleshooting:** Describe troubleshooting procedures and resources for diagnosing and resolving issues.
- **Training and Documentation:** Discuss training materials and documentation for developers, administrators, and end-users.

## 11. Glossary

- **Key Terminology:** Provide definitions for key terms and acronyms used throughout the document.

## 12. References
